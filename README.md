### Architecture

As the project owner, I've opted to kick off our development journey on GitHub with a Proof of Concept (POC). This POC is designed to test the waters and ensure our project's concept is feasible and effective before diving into full-scale development. By taking this approach, we aim to uncover potential roadblocks or technical issues early on, address feedback from potential collaborators, and make well-informed decisions before committing to extensive development. We look forward to your contributions and insights, hoping that together, we can strengthen and refine the project direction. Thank you for your participation and contributions!
